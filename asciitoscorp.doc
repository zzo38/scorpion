This program will accept a ASCII file (or it can use PC character encoding
or EUC character encoding, if declared in the file; both are supersets of
ASCII) from stdin, and write the Scorpion document file to stdout.


=== Syntax ===

<name> means a command (similar than <name> in HTML or <name/> in XML).

<name| and |name> are also commands but are the beginning and ending
commands (similar than <name> ... </name> in HTML or XML).

|name| or || is a middle command, to separate parts of a <x| |x> block.

<hex> represents a single graphic character by the character code. If the
current encoding is PC then it is always two hex digits (and zero is not
allowed; use FF or 20 instead), otherwise it is a TRON character code.

A blank line is a delimiter between blocks. Multiple blank lines between
blocks are redundant.

<$charset> sets the input and output character encoding. Valid encodings
are: PC, JP, CN, and KR. PC cannot be mixed with the other encodings in the
same block, but you can mix the other encodings with each other.

A line break is treated as a space in most contexts. Leading and trailing
spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces, are treated as a single space in
most contexts.

|= can be followed by a line break to suppress the extra space.

You can use <{ and }> or |{ and }| to surround text which should not be
interpreted as commands; they are interpreted as raw characters. They
must fit within a single line, though.

You can also use << and some other text on the same line, to mean a heredoc
which means that the rest of the text is interpreted as araw characters,
until a line that has the same text that followed << on the first line.
This is only useful in preformatted blocks, because in such a block it will
treat tabs as the <TAB> command and line breaks as the <BR> command.

<! command !> will execute an external program and use its output as the
source text that is accepted by this program. That output is not allowed to
itself include any <! !> block.


=== Commands ===

In the below list, ** means it is only allowed at the beginning of a block,
and it defines the block type. If no block type is specified, then it is a
normal paragraph block.

<1> or <1| name |1> **
  Make a level 1 heading (the outermost level). You can optionally specify
  a name which is used after the # in a URL to refer to that heading.
  There are also more heading levels 2 to 6.

<ALT| url |ALT> **
  Make a alternate service link, for mirrors, etc.

<ASK> or <ASK| url |ASK> **
  Make a link that requests input. If you use <ASK> without the URL, then
  it means to use the current URL.

<BR>
  Line break; only valid inside of a preformatted block.

<E> or <E| text |E>
  Set style to emphasis. (The second syntax will revert the style to the
  most recent one that uses the first syntax, afterward. Nesting is not
  allowed and will not work.)

<F> or <F| text |F>
  Set style to fixpitch.

<FUR| base || furigana |FUR>
  Make furigana text. You can use || or |FUR| to mean the same thing.

<INC| file name |INC> **
  Include the contents of another binary Scorpion document file. (It will
  validate that the data is correct.)

<INT> or <INT| url |INT> **
  Make a link to an interactive session.

<L> or <L| url |L> **
  Make a plain link. (The URL can be absolute or relative.)

<N> or <N| text |N>
  Set style to normal.

<PIPE| command |PIPE> **
  Like <INC> but uses the output of an external program instead.

<Q> **
  Begin a block quotation.

<R| text |R>
  The text will use the reverse text direction from that of the paragraph.
  The normal text direction of the paragraph is restored by |R>.

<RGR>
  Reset graphic rendition.

<S> or <S| text |S>
  Set style to strong.

<SGR| numbers |SGR>
  Set graphic rendition. Put the numbers with semicolons in between.

<TAB>
  Tab; only valid inside of a preformatted block.

<X> or <X| attribute |X> **
  Make a preformatted block.
