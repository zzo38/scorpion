This program will accept a ASCII file (or it can use PC character encoding
or EUC character encoding, if declared in the file; both are supersets of
ASCII) from stdin, and write the Scorpion document file to stdout.


=== Syntax ===

<name> means a command (similar than <name> in HTML or <name/> in XML).

<name| and |name> are also commands but are the beginning and ending
commands (similar than <name> ... </name> in HTML or XML).

|name| or || is a middle command, to separate parts of a <x| |x> block.

<hex> represents a single graphic character by the character code. If the
current encoding is PC then it is always two hex digits (and zero is not
allowed; use FF or 20 instead), otherwise it is a TRON character code.

A blank line is a delimiter between blocks. Multiple blank lines between
blocks are redundant.

<$charset> sets the input and output character encoding. Valid encodings
are: PC, JP, CN, and KR. PC cannot be mixed with the other encodings in the
same block, but you can mix the other encodings with each other.

A line break is treated as a space in most contexts. Leading and trailing
spaces, and multiple consecutive spaces, are treated as a single space in
most contexts.

|= can be followed by a line break to suppress the extra space.

You can use <{ and }> or |{ and }| to surround text which should not be
interpreted as commands; they are interpreted as raw characters. They
must fit within a single line, though.

You can also use << and some other text on the same line, to mean a heredoc
which means that the rest of the text is interpreted as araw characters,
until a line that has the same text that followed << on the first line.
This is only useful in preformatted blocks, because in such a block it will
treat tabs as the <TAB> command and line breaks as the <BR> command.

<! command !> will execute an external program and use its output as the
source text that is accepted by this program. That output is not allowed to
itself include any <! !> block.


=== Commands ===

In the below list, ** means it is only allowed at the beginning of a block,
and it defines the block type. If no block type is specified, then it is a
normal paragraph block.

||
  Outside of any other command that expects multiple parts, this command is
  used to separate the section number or item number (or bullet) from the
  rest of the text in the same heading or paragraph.

<1> or <1| name |1> **
  Make a level 1 heading (the outermost level). You can optionally specify
  a name which is used after the # in a URL to refer to that heading.
  There are also more heading levels 2 to 6.

<ALT| url |ALT> **
  Make a alternate service link, for mirrors, etc.

<ASK> or <ASK| url |ASK> **
  Make a link that requests input. If you use <ASK> without the URL, then
  it means to use the current URL.

<BR>
  Line break; only valid inside of a preformatted block.

<E> or <E| text |E>
  Set style to emphasis. (The second syntax will revert the style to the
  most recent one that uses the first syntax, afterward. Nesting is not
  allowed and will not work.)

<F> or <F| text |F>
  Set style to fixpitch.

<FI| size type |FI>
  Set file info in extended link attributes. Only valid in the body of a
  <L> or <ASK> block. (The type is optional and may be omitted. If the size
  is unknown, a question mark may be substituted in place of the size.)

<FIS> or <FIS| type |FIS>
  Set file info in extended link attributes; only valid in the body of a
  <L> block (not valid for <ASK>). The file size will be determined
  automatically, by attempting to read the file; if the file cannot be
  found, then it is an error. (Be careful with using this, that you do not
  end up reading a file whose size changes later, or a file in the wrong
  directory, etc.)

<FUR| base || furigana |FUR>
  Make furigana text. You can use || or |FUR| to mean the same thing.

<INC| file name |INC> **
  Include the contents of another binary Scorpion document file. (It will
  validate that the data is correct.)

<INT> or <INT| url |INT> **
  Make a link to an interactive session.

<L> or <L| url |L> **
  Make a plain link. (The URL can be absolute or relative.)

<N> or <N| text |N>
  Set style to normal.

<PIPE| command |PIPE> **
  Like <INC> but uses the output of an external program instead.

<Q> **
  Begin a block quotation.

<R| text |R>
  The text will use the reverse text direction from that of the paragraph.
  The normal text direction of the paragraph is restored by |R>.

<RGR>
  Reset graphic rendition.

<S> or <S| text |S>
  Set style to strong.

<SGR| numbers |SGR>
  Set graphic rendition. Put the numbers with semicolons in between.

<TAB>
  Tab; only valid inside of a preformatted block.

<X> or <X| attribute |X> **
  Make a preformatted block.
