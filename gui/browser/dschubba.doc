##### DSCHUBBA #####


=== Configuration ===

The .dschubba/config file is the main configuration file.

A blank line or a line starting with ; or # is ignored. Any other line is
a key=value pair. Types are integer, boolean (0 for false and 1 for true),
string, and float. The possible keys are:

* dumpfontconfig (boolean) = If true, dump the font configuration to
stdout. This is mainly useful for testing and debugging.

* height (integer) = The window height in pixels.

* resizable (boolean) = Set to 1 (the default) to tell the window manager
to allow the window to be resized, or to 0 to tell the window manager that
it should not allow the window to be resized. (This affects the default
layout of the window in some tiling window managers.)

* width (integer) = The window width in pixels.


=== Font configuration ===

The .dschubba/fontconfig file has the syntax described here.

Any blank line and any line starting with # is a comment.

The possible text formats are N (normal), S (strong), E (emphasis), F
(fixpitch), U (furigana), and * (applies to all text formats).

A line with a name in () defines a font group (which is a set of fonts and
font sets of a specific size). There are three kind of commands that can be
used inside of the definition of a font group:

* Font specification by text formatting: Write one or more of the text
formatting characters (N, S, E, F, U, *) followed by a colon and then the
character set name and then another colon and then the file name. If the
character set is "TRON" then it may include * and/or ? to match multiple
file names; you can also specify it more than once if it is "TRON" (but
otherwise you cannot specify multiple files).

* Scaling fonts in this font group: Write the X scale and Y scale amounts
with "x" in between.

* Scaling fonts from another font group if none in this group match: Write
the X scale and Y scale amounts with "x" in between, and then a colon and
the name of the another font group.

A line with a name in [] defines a block style. The name must be one of the
block types, as follows: NORM, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, LINK, LINK_ASK,
LINK_INTER, LINK_ALT, QUOTE, PRE, META, EOF, ERR, INFO, SYS. The commands
which can be used inside of this section are the parameter name and then =
and then the value. The possible parameters are:

* Color = The colour of the text.

* Copy = The name of another block style (which must have already been
defined); copies the parameters of that block style. Any parameters added
after the Copy command will override them for this block style.

* Depth = Distance below the base line of the last line of text of this
block before the next block begins.

* Fonts = Specify which font group to use.

* Height = Distance below the end of the previous block before the base
line of the first character of this block begins.

* Indent = Extra horizontal space at the beginning of the block, on the
first line only; added to the left margin amount. This number would usually
be positive or zero, but also may be negative, unlike other parameters.

* Leading = Distance between base lines.

* LeftMargin = Space between the left edge of the window and the text.

* RightMargin = Space between the right edge of the window and the text.

A line with a name in <> defines a character set. Character set names
"TRON" and "PC" are built-in, although you can still redefine them. Inside
of this block you can have name=parameter like in the [] block, but the
set of possible parameters is different:

* Alias = Define an alias. This parameter can occur multiple times; each
time, the value is another name which is an alias of this character set. It
is not allowed for the alias to be the same name as a character set which
is defined as a <> block, nor are "TRON" and "PC" allowed as aliases.

* Alternate = Specify a character set to use if this one is unavailable.
This can only occur once per character set, although it is OK for multiple
character sets to have the same alternate.

* Map = Specify a mapping to TRON code. You must specify a file name.


=== FAQ ===

** What is the origin of the name?

It is the name of a star in the constellation Scorpius, and it is a Arabic
word meaning forehead of scorpion.
