-A #
  Specify a IP address and port number (with a colon in between) to use
  instead of resolving the host name in the URL.

-B #
  Specify base URL to be relative to. If not specified, then the URL will
  be relative to the current directory.

-C #
  Specify file name for client certificate (PEM format).

-D
  Delete a remote file. (Not valid for all protocols.)

-K #
  Specify file name for private key of client certificate (PEM format).

-O
  Allow a remote file to be overwritten. (Some protocols cannot distinguish
  overwriting an existing file vs creating a new file; in that case, this
  switch is meaningless.)

-Q
  Only display the components of the parsed URL and terminate; do not try
  to download or upload anything, and do not make any network accesses.

-T #
  TLS options.

-V #
  For Scorpion, set new version code for uploaded file.

-Y #
  ULFI testing mode.

-h
  Write headers (in Scorpion format) to stdout. If not specified, then
  status codes other than 2x, 7x, and 8x are errors. (If -O is not
  specified, then 71 is also an error, even if -h is specified.)

-i #
  Upload the specified number of bytes from stdin.

-n
  Disable buffering.

-o #
  Set output file. If not specified, it will be written to stdout. If the
  file already exists, it will continue from where it left off; this is
  only possible for protocols that allow range requests.

-p
  Display progress indicator on stderr. (It will write a carriage return
  before each progress display.)

-r #
  Make a range request. The value must be two numbers with - in between,
  being zero-based byte offsets; it includes the beginning and excludes
  the ending offset. The ending offset can be omitted if you want to
  download everything up to the end of the file.

-t #
  Set MIME or ULFI type for uploaded file. The default value depends on
  the protocol, and some protocols have other restrictions, or do not
  allow this at all (e.g. NNTP only allows "message/rfc822").

-u #
  Specify file to upload. This must be a seekable file, so that it can
  measure the size of the input file.

-v #
  For Scorpion, set version of remote file to replace. For Gemini, set
  the value of the security token for uploads using Titan.
