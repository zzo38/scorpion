# Scorpion Protocol/File-Format

This is the repository for the specification and reference implementation
of the Scorpion protocol/file-format.

There are some similarities than Gemini protocol/file-format, and HTTP, and
also Spartan protocol, but there are many significant differences. If you
have some criticisms of Gemini then you might be interested in this.

See the file called [Specification](/Specification) for details. (There is a
FAQ section near the end.)

There is available the [Fossil](http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/scorpion.ui)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/zzo38/scorpion).

You are free to make the comments/questions/criticisms of it, please. You are
also free to make your own implementations, servers, clients, and to make
suggestions, bug reports, etc.
